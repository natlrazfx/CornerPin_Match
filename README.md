# cornerpin_match
Designed for working with CornerPin2D nodes, particularly when using data from Mocha. It copies the values from the "to" parameters to the "from" parameters and removes any existing animation from the "from" parameters in the selected CornerPin2D nodes. This simplifies the process of resetting or reapplying corner pin data.
